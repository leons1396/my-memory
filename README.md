# Memory Game GUI Application

## Overview

This repository contains a simple GUI application that implements a **Memory Game** built using **Tkinter** in Python. You can customize the memory cards by using
any images you want by displaying them instead of the cards. The frontend is kept very simple for this application.
This application can be used to gain a basic understanding of object-oriented programming, Tkinter and a practical usage of the mvc pattern.  

The architecture of this project follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern, which separates the application logic into three interconnected components:

- **Model**: Manages the data and the game logic.
- **View**: Represents the user interface elements and displays the game's state.
- **Controller**: Handles user input, updates the model, and refreshes the view.

## Game

- up to 4 Players
- 3 Difficulty levels (easy=12 cards, medium=16 cards, hard=20 cards)
